For example, when applying for a licence, the information required of telephony providers includes detailed data on their plannned networks. This information is not appropriate to broadcasters, but the latter do have to provide additional details on programming format and their target audience. Accordingly, different <a href="https://www.ofreg.ky/ict/application-forms" name="application forms">application forms</a> have been designed for telephony network and service providers, and these are available in this section of our site.</p>
