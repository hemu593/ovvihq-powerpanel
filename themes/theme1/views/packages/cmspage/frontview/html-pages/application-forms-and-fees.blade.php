Where a single application covers more than one network or service, the total application fee is the sum of the fees for the individual networks and services. Cheques should be made out to "OfReg", and should be in Cayman Islands' Dollars drawn on a Cayman Islands' bank. </p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that no application will be processed until all application fees have been received.</p>

Where a Person wishing to provide Information Security Services makes application to the Office for an ICT Service Licence, the Office will process that application in the same manner and to the same standards as it would process applications for any other type of ICT Service Licence, and the Office may decline to award such Licence.</li>

                                    <h2>How will Licence Fees be calculated?</h2>
                                    <p>The licence fees will be calculated and paid in arrears on a quarterly basis with an annual true up mechanism based on the Licensee's annual audited financial statements.</p>
                                    <p>For each Licensee, licence fees will be comprised of a <strong>royalty fee</strong> and a<strong> regulatory fee.</strong></p>
                                    <p>The <strong>royalty fee</strong>, which is set by the Government, will be 6% of each Licensee's revenues. The <strong>regulatory fee</strong>, which is based on the Office's costs for regulating ICT Sector One, will be pro-rated across all Licensees based on each Licensee's quarterly revenues as a percentage of all Licensees' quarterly revenues. Both components of the licence fee will be remitted by Licensees on quarterly to the Office.</p>
                                    <p>The Office will use Licensees' revenues for the quarter immediately preceding the quarter for which licence fees are due for purposes of calculating each Licensee's regulatory fee. In part, the reason for this is because of the time it will take for the Office to calculate the regulatory fee payable by each Licensee which can only be done after all Licensees provide their revenues. Given that Licensees' revenues will only be available some time after the end of the last month of each quarter, the Office is concerned that using revenues for the immediately preceding quarter would result in undue delays in calculating and collecting regulatory fees. Hence, the Office has decided to use revenues for the quarter prior to the immediately preceding quarter to calculate each Licensee's regulatory fee.</p>
                                    <h2>The quarterly licence fee therefore will comprise of</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>a royalty fee to be calculated as 6% of the Licensee's quarterly revenues; and</li>
                                        <li>a regulatory fee to be calculated based on the Officeâ€™s quarterly on going expenditures for the regulation of ICT Networks and ICT Services multiplied by the Licenseeâ€™s revenues for the quarter immediately preceding the quarter for which licence fees are due, divided by all Licenseesâ€™ revenues for the same quarter.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The regulatory fee to be paid by each Licensee during the Office's financial year (i.e., 1 July to 30 June) shall not exceed six hundred thousand dollars.</p>
                                    <p>When the results for a Licenseeâ€™s financial year are finalised and it transpires that the audited revenues are higher than the sum of the unaudited quarterly revenues, which were used to calculate licence fees during the year, the Licensee will be liable for an additional royalty fee equal to 6% of the difference between the audited revenues and the sum of its unaudited quarterly revenues. This will be payable forthwith upon submission of the Licenseeâ€™s annual audited financial statements, which are due no later than three months after the end of its financial year. If, on the other hand, the Licenseeâ€™s audited revenues are lower than the sum of its unaudited revenues, the Office will calculate and apply an equivalent credit to the Licenseeâ€™s royalty fee for the current year. In either case, the Office does not anticipate collecting additional regulatory fees.</p>
                                    <h2>What constitutes Revenues for Licence Fee purposes?</h2>
                                    <p>Revenues for purposes of calculating the royalty fee and the regulatory fee are defined as:</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>The total amount of receipts in money or moneyâ€™s worth received by the Licensee from all sources arising out of or in connection with the Licenseeâ€™s business in or from the Cayman Islands for a defined period of time (e.g., monthly, quarterly or annually, as the case may be).</p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <h2>Less</h2>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Payments made to other ICT Licensees for interconnection, infrastructure or wholesale services for that same period; and</li>
                                        <li>Settlement payments made to international carriers for international traffic, including adjustments to payments for such traffic for that same period. If any of the payments are made to a Licenseeâ€™s affiliate, the amount deducted for purposes of calculating revenues will be only to the extent that those payments are made at open market value on an armâ€™s-length basis; and</li>
                                        <li>Non-recurring extra-ordinary items of receipt (including real estate) that are not made in the ordinary course of business.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>While the definition of revenues in the licence uses the words "money or money's worth received", the Information and Communications Technology Law (Determination of Turnover) Order, 2004, for the purposes of then section 34Q(8) of the ICT Law, defined "turnover" to mean the total amount of receipts in money or money's worth earned by a licensee. The Office uses that definition for licence fee purposes and therefore, for the purposes of calculating the royalty fee and the regulatory fee, Licensees are to report based on money or money's worth earned.</p>
                                    <p>A Licensee must report its quarterly turnover and quarterly revenues in a licence fee report, the format of which is attached as Schedule 1 to the Guidelines document.</p>
