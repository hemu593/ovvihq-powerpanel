                            <p>Normally, anyone who imports a radio transceiver into the Cayman Islands is required to pay a fee of C.I.$10.00 per radio transceiver to OfReg (or the 'Office') prior to clearing it from Customs.</p>
                            <p>A retailer may apply for a Type U Radio Dealer Licence from the Office, (see Notice under s23(2) ICT Law (Networks and Services requiring a licence).) which exempts the holder of that Licence from having to obtain from the Office a CI$10 import Licence for each radio transceiver that they import for subsequent resale.</p>
                            <p>There is no requirement for a retailer to apply for this type of licence.</p>

                            <p>The cost of such a Licence is currently CI$150 per annum. That sum is payable to the Office at the time of the initial application for that Licence, and thereafter on or before the annual expiry date of the Licence.</p>
                            <p>Each person who holds a Type U Radio Dealer Licence must provide to the Office each month (in an MS Excel spreadsheet format) details of the equipment sold and a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of the person to whom they sold that radio transceiver to in the previous month.</p>
